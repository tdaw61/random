Project 1

We completed everything but the jal. The j and bne commands do not work correctly. The PC jumps to the correct location 
but it still loads the PC+4 instruction. We have screen shots of the project working with the exception of j, bne, and jal.  
We also included a screenshot of the latest project we had with the j and bne not working.  There is also a screenshot of the fetch
unit.  The test benches for all of these will be included as well. We also talked with Jonathan about our lw command 
because it randomly dropped the signal in the middle of a clock cycle with no other inputs changing. We never found the source
of that error either so we are not sure if that is fully functional either.
