 My Makefile will compile a working executeable for the four main files frequencies huffman 
encode and decode.  frequencies and huffman work but encode does not work correctly and 
neither does decode.  My encode puts out the wrong code so decode could possibly work but it 
will not work with any input that encode gives out.
