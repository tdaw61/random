ReadMe:

to configure a .exe file type make in the directory, and a prog1.exe file will be created.

The program handles input as follows:
the program is case sensitive and uses insert x, delete x, deleteMin, lookup x, and print as keywords to do their respective Quash functions.
x can only be an integer.
each input should be separated by a new line.
EOF is how my program exits from an input file.

Otherwise in Unix the ctrl c command works, but ctrl d will not work.

the output will tell if a command is successful or not, and the print function will print out the heap first followed by the hash table.
the hash table and heap both use E to signify empty and D for deleted.

The hash table key does not refer to the actual key of the value in the array, it simply refers to the bucket it is in the table.
