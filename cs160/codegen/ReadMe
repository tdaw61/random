This project is not done completely.  The array part is wrong, but I made some effort at trying to make it work, I also did not deal with any optimization and did not use any lattice elements.
Other then that there were some errors that I could not resolve in other places, but for the most part all the code is generated, it is just a little off. I sent
an email about my corrections to project 4, and hopefully that will help me out some. Thanks!
