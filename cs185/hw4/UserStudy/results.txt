Analysis of the Numberpicker and Wheel data

The result of the ttest turned out to be .0081971979.

By looking at the tables, it is obvious that the two interfaces performed in a very different manner.
The times that were experienced were far different between the two interfaces, but within the
actual interface the individual testers experienced similar times.  

This result clearly shows that it is far below a calculated t from a T table with any
range of significance, and so the means are clearly different from each other.  
This is very clear not only from the ttest, but by simply looking at the actual
entries in the table as well. The average of the three inputs for the numberpicker are clearly
higher in all three cases, and the two series of data don't even overlap.  This 
will clearly show up in the ttest as a major discrepancy, and the Numberpicker is shown to be the 
slower of the two.  

In looking at the pre-test and post-test questionairre answers, first off the pre-test results are 
very similar.  This sets up a possibility for the results to be closer then if the test subjects 
were more randomly selected.  The trend for the post-test questions follow closely with the actual
numerical results of the testing, the users all found that the wheel was much easier to use, and 
felt much more comfortable with this format.  The other trends and patterns are harder to make out, 
because the results do not exactly fall in line with expectations according to the post-test questions.
The main general trend is the most important finding though, and that is the fact that the wheel was
a better performer and it was preferred by all users involved.   

Although the usage of the ttest proved beyond a doubt that the two groups of data were not related, 
the initial results were very spread and that could have been deducted by simply looking at the table.
It seems that all users involved not only prefer the wheel interface, but the acutal performance is 
substantially better as well.
