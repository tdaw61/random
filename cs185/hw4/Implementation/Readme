This implementation should be working just fine on a 4.0.3 emulator, at least it sure works for me.
The only problem I found was that I do not load my list correctly when orientation changes, but once a 
new entry is made it updates the entire list.  The alertboxes I use as well as the select statement for
when a menu item is selected I found online in a tutorial and used the base code to help me with the dialogs.
